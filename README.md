# Graph-Based Categorical Embedding

This repository contains the code and resources related to the paper titled **"Graph-Based Categorical Embedding"** by Weiwei Wang, Stefano Bromuri, and Michel Dumontier, presented at ESANN 2023.

## Overview

Categorical embedding is a critical technique in machine learning and AI for converting categorical data into a numerical form that algorithms can efficiently process. 
Our paper introduces a novel approach using graph-based methods to enhance the embedding of categorical variables. This approach leverages the relationships between categories represented as a graph to produce more meaningful and informative embeddings.
